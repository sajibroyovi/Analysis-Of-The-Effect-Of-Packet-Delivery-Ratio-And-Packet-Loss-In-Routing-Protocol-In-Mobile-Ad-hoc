# Analysis-Of-The-Effect-Of-Packet-Delivery-Ratio-And-Packet-Loss-In-Routing-Protocol-In-Mobile-Ad-hoc
The fundamental techniques for designing any wireless network are path routing and protocol 
selection. The chosen protocol in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) should have the greatest 
data delivery and data integrity. As a result, analyzing the performance of the protocols is a 
crucial step before deciding on one. The performance of the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance 
Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), and 
Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) protocols is investigated using the NS2 
simulator in this article. The four most frequent measurements used to compare the 
performance of the above protocols are Packet delivery ratio, Average throughput, Packet loss, 
and End to end delay.
A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes that build a 
network dynamically and without the assistance of a central management system. Furthermore, 
because every node in MANET travels at random, the topology of the multi-hop network 
changes at unpredictable periods. AODV, DSR, OLSR and DSDV are just a few of the wellknown routing protocols. Which have been presented as a means of facilitating communication 
amongst all nodes in a wireless network. Using the NS-2 simulator, this article compares and 
studies the performance of reactive (AODV) and proactive (DSDV) protocols based on 
parameters including average throughput, packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, 
packet loss rate, and spent energy. DSDV is ideal for small networks, whereas AODV is best 
for bigger networks
